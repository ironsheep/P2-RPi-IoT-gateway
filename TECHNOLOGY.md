# P2 RPi ioT Gateway - Technology used

Enable an RPi to serve as an ioT gateway for our P2 Hardware - while dedicating only 2 pins for serial communication

## P2 communication with RPi

We use a simple Full-duplex serial link between your P2 board and the Raspberry Pi. We've crafted two .spin2 objects which are compiled into your code (The gateway object and a serial line-receiving queue object.) To configure the gateway you specify which two P2 pins are to be used when communicating with the RPi and iidenitfy the application running the gateway.

To use this in your own project you simply compile-in the gateway objects, start it and then make calls to it.

### IoT Gateway Objects

The following objects are compiled into your app.

- isp\_rpi\_iot_gw.spin2
- isp\_queue_serial.spin2
- jm_serial.spin2
- jm_nstrings.spin2

You simply include them with something like:

```script
OBJ { Objects Used by this Object }

    IoT_GW      :   "isp_rpi_iot_gw"            ' serial I/O to/from RPi
    rxQue       :   "isp_queue_serial"          ' acces our received data
```

Starting the gateway is also pretty simple:

```script
CON { RPi Gateway io pins }

  RX_GW    = 25  { I }                                          ' Raspberry Pi (RPi) Gateway
  TX_GW    = 24  { O }

  GW_BAUDRATE = 624_000   ' 624kb/s - allow P2 rx to keep up!

DAT { our hardware ID strings and 1-wire buffers, collection names }

  p2HardwareID    byte    "{your hardware descr here}",0

PUB main() | eOpStatus, nIdx, nCollId, eRxQStatus, eCmdId, tmpVar

    '' DEMO send status values to a web page and act on control values sent by the web page
    IoT_GW.startx(RX_GW, TX_GW, GW_BAUDRATE)    ' tell singleton our pins and rate

    ' (one time) tell the RPi about how to identify this hardware
    IoT_GW.identify(@p2HardwareID)

  ... and do your app stuff from here on ...
```

## Gateway Deamon on RPi

On the RPi we have a single Python3 script which is run interactively or from power-on which listens to the serial traffic arriving from the P2. It validates the requests coming from the P2, and then acts on the request. Validation status and optionally requested data are returned to the P2 for each request.

The Daemon script also watches for directory changes (files to be modified or new files appearing) in the Control directory.  Web pages that want to send values to our P2 write to this Control directory. The P2 application tells the RPi if it wants to be told of changes to specific files on the RPi. If the RPi knows that the P2 is listening and the file is changes the RPi sends each KV pair found in the changed file to the waiting P2.
