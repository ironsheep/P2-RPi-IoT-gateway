## Install the Backend web server along with the PHP interpreter

By default our Raspberry Pi OS that we chose does not come with the web server installed. However it is very easy to install it.  

Before we do any new software installation let's make sure we have the latest updates to our existing installed software.  Remember the `upd` command you installed. Let's run that now:

```bash
$ upd
+ sudo apt-get update
Hit:1 http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian bullseye InRelease                                                      
Hit:2 http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian bullseye InRelease

```

Ok, ours is up-to-date.

Now let's install the web server and it's documentation:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc php
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
  apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils libapr1 libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libapache2-mod-php7.4 php-common php7.4 php7.4-cli php7.4-common php7.4-json php7.4-opcache php7.4-readline libaprutil1-ldap liblua5.3-0
Suggested packages:
  apache2-suexec-pristine | apache2-suexec-custom php-pear
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  apache2 apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-doc apache2-utils libapr1 libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap liblua5.3-0 libapache2-mod-php7.4 php php-common php7.4 php7.4-cli php7.4-common php7.4-json php7.4-opcache php7.4-readline
0 upgraded, 10 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 6,260 kB of archives.
After this operation, 32.6 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 
```

(Simply press return at the [Y/n] prompt to proceed with the install.)

### Adjust web page folders

Let's adjust the web page folders so that creating files at the `pi` user will not interfere with the pages being dimsplayed:

```bash
$ ls -lh /var/www/
$ sudo chgrp www-data /var/www  # set group to the web server group
$ sudo chmod g+s /var/www  # set sticky bit so files created under here will be set to group
$ sudo chown -R pi:www-data /var/www/html/  # recursively change owner of files/folder within
$ sudo chmod -R 770 /var/www/html/ 
$ ls -lh /var/www/
$ sudo service apache2 restart  # restart server to pick up latest changes
```

TODO: *adjust apache2 setup so that .php suffix automatically invokes php so filetype is not needed on URL!*

### Create PHP Test page

Create a simple but useful PHP test file `info.php` and place it in `/var/www/html` - the file should contain the following 3 lines:

```php
<?php  
phpinfo()
?>
```

### Testing the install

Now let's test both the server and the php execution under the server:

Browse to `http://{fullrpihostname|or ip address}/` - this should display the default web page:

![RPi New install Web page](Docs/Images/DefaultWWWPage.png)

Next, browse to `http://{fullrpihostname|or ip address}/info.php` - this should display the new PHP Info page:


![New PHP Info Page](Docs/Images/NewPhpInfoPage.png)

If you are seeing these pages the Apache2 web server and the PHP interpreter packages are installed and working. You are now ready to play with the new Web Served P2 data DEMOs!
