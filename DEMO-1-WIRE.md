# P2 RPi ioT Gateway - Web: 1-wire Demo

Enable an RPi to serve as an ioT gateway for our P2 Hardware - while dedicating only 2 pins for serial communication

## Files associated with this Demo

This demo consists of a web page to be placed where the RPi web server can find it and a P2 .spin2 file which runs on your P2 hardware connected via serial to your RPi Gateway.

| Spin2/webPage File Name(s) | Demonstration | Form 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [demo\_p2gw_1wireStatus.spin2](P2-Source/demo_p2gw_1wireStatus.spin2) | Display live 1-wire temp sensor data - read sensor send data to status folder on gateway | App
| [Archive of Demo Wab Page](demoWebPageSets/demoFiles-bs1wire.tar.gz) | Display live 1-wire temp sensor data - web page shows reported sensor data along with details of the RPi host which is running the web server | Web Page Folder 

Once this web page is put into place and the demo is run on the P2 you browse to the web page being presented from the RPi to see the new web sensor page:

## Wiring the 1-wire device

The **demo\_p2gw_1wireStatus.spin2** program is configured to use P2 pin 16 for the 1-wire device.


**P2 Connections expected by Demo:**

| P2 Purpose | P2 Pin # |
| --- | --- |
| Signal ground | GND near Pin 16|
| 1-wire data (DS18S20) | 16

Pick a pin on your P2 dev board to be used for 1-wire communications. The demo file provided by this project defines this pin to be 16. Feel free to choose a different pin. Just remember to adjust the constant in your code to use your pin choice.

## Install the 1-wire demo

The .spin2 source for this demo is found in `/opt/P2-RPi-ioT-gateway/P2-Source` You will need to install the web page source under the web server.

Installing is pretty easy. The web-page demo files are also present. They live in `/opt/P2-RPi-ioT-gateway/demoWebPageSets/`.  To unpack this demo file do:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
tar -xzvf /opt/P2-RPi-ioT-gateway/demoWebPageSets/demoFiles-bs1wire.tar.gz
```

This should create a folder `/var/www/html/bs1wire/' which now has a top-level `index.php` page therein.

After these files are unpacked you should be able to point your browser to: `http://{mypihostname|orIpAddress/bs1wire`

All that's left then is run the demo .spin2 on your P2 after making sure your P2 and your RPi are connected via serial and that your Gateway Daemon is already running.

This demo should provide a good reference for how to create similar services. 

Enjoy!

##  Collections Used by this Demo

**remember:** *collections in gateway parlance are files which contain one or more key-value pairs.*

This demo uses a couple of collections (files) on the RPi. The status file is created when the P2 reads the Temperature 1-wire device and sends the value to the RPi. The Proc file is generated automatically whenever the Daemon is run.

Collections used:

| Collection Name | Created By | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STATUS/**p2-1wireValues** | P2 write action | Value to send to web page
| PROC/**rpiHostInfo** | RPi Daemon | RPi details to be shown on web page

Within the status file the P2 places one key-value pair:

| Status Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tempSensorStr | Temperature value (string) to be shown on web page

Whenever the web page is loaded (or reloaded - every N seconds) this file is read, the value for `tempSensorStr` is pulled from the file and shown on the web page

Additionally the web page shows content from one of our generated files **PROC/rpiHostInfo** which is maintained by our RPi Daemon and contains details of the RPi upon which the Daemon is running.

##  Tool I used to create the web page

I run on a Mac desktop.  My favorite tool for creating web pages is [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io/)  This tool provides easy WYSIWYG editing, easy CSS styling, good responsive layout code, and exports tiney files for you to place on your server.
